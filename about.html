        The film, shot entirely on an iPhone, follows a girl trapped in a mysterious time loop. 
        Each time she descends a staircase, she finds herself back at the top again, greeted in the 
        exact same way by her friend. The cycle repeats endlessly, blending the ordinary with the 
        uncanny, as the girl struggles to make sense of the repetition and search for a way out. 
        Does she make it out? Watch to find out.

        I had this idea that I wanted to make a kind of horror film which the team agreed with. 
        We went through a lot of pitches for how to make a quick film that also felt scary on campus. 
        Suddenly, I remembered reading a story the other day about a girl trapped in a time loop.

        We decided to make it seem more confusing and psychological by having the setting stay the same 
        on the stairwell. Xiaotan had a good idea for the shots and how to film them, including the
        brilliant birds eye view shot of us walking from opposing stairwells. The images above represent the
        moodboard of the direction of the film.
